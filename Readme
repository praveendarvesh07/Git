Transition Plan Dashboard

This project is a single-page HTML dashboard designed to track the weekly effort transition of responsibilities from a Solution Advisor (SA) to Partner Enablement (PE). It includes fixed plan data, dynamic summary metrics, and real-time collaborative task addition powered by Google Firebase Firestore.

Files in this Repository

index.html: The complete, self-contained web application (HTML, CSS via Tailwind CDN, and JavaScript).

README.md: This file.

.gitignore: Standard file to ignore build artifacts.

Features

Real-time Task Collaboration: Users can add new tasks assigned to specific team members (Hanno, Tom, Prashant). These tasks are stored in Firestore and updated instantly for all users.

Progress Tracking: Summary cards display overall progress, total SA effort, total PE effort, and completed weeks.

Responsive Design: Styled using Tailwind CSS for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices.

Setup and Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed in an environment that injects specific Firebase configuration variables at runtime.

Local Development (Static Content Only)

Clone this repository:

git clone [your-repo-url]
cd transition-plan-dashboard


Open index.html directly in your web browser.

Note: The Firebase functionality (adding new tasks, real-time updates) will not work locally because the application requires the __firebase_config and __initial_auth_token global variables, which are injected by the target deployment environment (e.g., Google Canvas/App Engine). You will see error messages related to missing Firebase configuration in the console.

Deployment (Firebase/Real-time Enabled)

To enable real-time features, you must deploy this application to an environment that provides the following global JavaScript variables:

__app_id: The unique ID for the application artifact.

__firebase_config: A JSON string containing your Firebase project configuration (API key, project ID, etc.).

__initial_auth_token: A Firebase Custom Auth Token used to sign in the user for Firestore access.

The application uses the following Firestore public collection path: /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/transition_tasks. Ensure your Firebase Security Rules grant read/write access to authenticated users in this path.
